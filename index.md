### Here's My Story

From a young age, I’ve always felt a deep connection to nature. Whether it was building forts and playing in the woods as a child or surfing and snorkeling in the ocean, this bond has shaped who I am. I have also always lived surrounded by water. I’ve lived along the banks of the Mississippi River, the shores of Jupiter, Florida (a city known for its scenic beaches and waterfront parks), and now in Madison, Wisconsin, where Lake Mendota lies to the north and Lake Monona to the south—two of the area’s largest lakes, vital to both local ecology and recreation. As I reflect on my life, I realize that this connection to nature has been more profound and enduring than I realized.

Over the years, I’ve also been somewhat of an entrepreneur and have started a few various businesses. However, I’ve always felt a strong pull to do something more meaningful. I have also been lucky enough to travel to many beautiful places around this continent—from the expansive mountains of Glacier National Park in Montana to the diverse and proliferating wildlife in the Ten Thousand Islands down in the Everglades National Park; to the beating heart of Pele in the Kīlauea volcano at Volcanoes National Park. In each of these places, as I have visited them many times through the years, I have seen the changes and noticed the impact we, as people, have had on these places. I’ve seen the garbage people have left behind, and I’ve been stunned by the amount of plastic and Styrofoam piling up on the beaches and in areas all over this world. Every time I return to my corner of the woods in Wisconsin, I work to make a small change in some of our family's habits, such as getting rid of all our plastic Tupperware or replacing our regular plastic garbage bags with compostable ones. Well, if you are anything like me, sometimes you're successful at changing habits, and most times you're not. We always get caught up in all the other things happening in our life, right?

We've gotten pretty disciplined at recycling, as I think most of the U.S. has. But have you ever actually tried to learn about what is recyclable and what truly isn't? It's a maze of information that, honestly, no one really has the time for. That’s when the vision for Eco Synergy Partners came to life—a nonprofit that I am forming, dedicated to reducing plastic and Styrofoam pollution by promoting sustainable alternatives for businesses, educating the public, and advocating for systemic change.

The plastic pollution crisis is devastating both wildlife and human health. Over 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans each year, choking marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Sea turtles, whales, and seabirds often mistake plastic for food, leading to injury or death. On land, Styrofoam and plastic waste take centuries to decompose, leaching harmful chemicals into the soil and water. For humans, microplastics are now found in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat, linked to serious health issues like hormone disruption, cancer, and developmental problems in children.

I believe we can create real change, but it’s not something I can do alone. I’ve read, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” That’s why I’m asking for your help.

Please consider joining me on this journey. Even if you’re not ready to contribute financially, I challenge you to take a moment to reflect on your habits. What small changes can you make to reduce your impact? What sustainable choices can you embrace in your everyday life? Every little step counts. Together, we can make a lasting difference and create a cleaner, more sustainable future.
