### Here's My Story 

From a young age, I’ve always felt a deep connection to nature. Whether it was building forts and playing in the woods as a child or surfing and snorkeling in the ocean, this bond has shaped who I am. Water has always been a constant in my life—I’ve lived along the banks of the Mississippi River, the shores of Jupiter, Florida (a city known for its scenic beaches and vibrant marine life), and now in Madison, Wisconsin, where Lake Mendota lies to the north and Lake Monona to the south. These two lakes are vital to the area’s ecology and recreation. As I reflect on my journey, I realize that this connection to nature has been more profound and enduring than I ever imagined.
